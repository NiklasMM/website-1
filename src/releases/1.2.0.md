This version brings a major change to the Miniflux database management.

Until now, Miniflux was designed to work for only one user.
Handling multiple users was possible by using a Sqlite database for each user.

Now, the database schema and the code base have been modified to handle several users with only one database.
Moreover, Miniflux supports Postgresql in addition to Sqlite.

Using Postgres could avoid some potential issues when the concurrency on the database is too high (locking problems).
That also facilitates the deployment of Miniflux to some cloud providers that does not allow software to store persistent data on the local file system.
